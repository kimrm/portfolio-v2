              After working well over a decade developing Windows applications
              with .NET I have shifted my focus to web development, and
              specifically frontend development, the last couple of years. I
              have experience with both frontend and backend development, and I
              have worked with a variety of technologies and frameworks. I have
              a passion for creating user-friendly and visually appealing
              websites and applications. I am currently available for new
              projects, and I am open for both contracts or employment.
